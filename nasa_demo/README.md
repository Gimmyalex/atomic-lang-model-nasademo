# NASA Telemetry Demo for the Atomic Language Model (ALM)

## 1. Purpose of this Demonstration

This application is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how the **Atomic Language Model (ALM)** can be used for advanced anomaly detection in mission-critical telemetry streams.

The core idea is to treat the stream of operational events from a spacecraft or rover not as a simple sequence of numbers, but as a **formal language**. An "anomaly" is therefore not just a statistical outlier, but an **"ungrammatical" sequence of events** that violates the defined rules of operation.

This demo showcases a hybrid AI approach that provides two layers of analysis:

1.  **Formal Grammatical Analysis (Rust Core):** Detects hard violations of operational rules. It answers the question: *"Was this sequence of events physically possible and did it follow mission rules?"*
2.  **Probabilistic Analysis (Python Core):** Detects subtle, system-wide deviations from normal patterns. It answers the question: *"Even if this sequence was possible, how surprising or improbable was it?"*

## 2. The "Language" of the Mission Log

This demo uses a simulated mission log found in `data/mission_log_large.csv`. This file was generated by the `generate_mission_log.py` script.

The "words" of our language are the events in the `event` column, such as:
- `MOTOR_CMD_START` (a command)
- `CURRENT_DRAW` (a state measurement)
- `VOLTAGE_SPIKE` (a state measurement)

The "grammar" is a set of rules defined in the ALM's Rust core (`atomic-lang-model/src/lib.rs`) that dictates valid sequences. For example:
- A `State` event (like `CURRENT_DRAW`) can be followed by another `State` or a `Command`.
- A `Command` event (like `MOTOR_CMD_START`) must be followed by a `State`.
- A `VOLTAGE_SPIKE` is defined as a "terminal" state; it is ungrammatical for it to be followed by another state measurement without a new command, representing a potential fault that breaks the normal chain of operations.

## 3. How to Run the Demo

**Prerequisites:**
- The project's Rust core must be compiled. If you have followed the main project setup, this should already be done. If not, run `maturin develop` from the `atomic-lang-model` directory.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Open a terminal** in the root directory of the `atomic-lang-model` project.

2.  **Activate the Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python nasa_demo/app.py
    ```

4.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
    [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## 4. Interpreting the Results

After clicking the "Analyze Mission Log" button, you will see two key outputs:

### Mission Surprise Score (Probabilistic Analysis)

-   **What it is:** This score (technically, the average negative log probability) measures how predictable the entire 500-event log was.
-   **How to interpret it:** A score closer to **0** indicates a routine, predictable mission log. A more negative score (e.g., -0.5 or lower) would indicate that the sequence of events was highly improbable and surprising, suggesting a subtle, system-wide anomaly that might not have broken any hard rules. This is a powerful tool for detecting developing faults.

### Detected Anomalies (Formal Analysis)

-   **What it is:** This is a list of event pairs that were found to be "ungrammatical" by the ALM's Rust core.
-   **How to interpret it:** Each entry in this list represents a definitive violation of the mission's operational grammar. The explanation tells you exactly which two events occurred in an invalid sequence. This provides precise, verifiable, and actionable alerts for mission operators.
