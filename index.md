# Welcome to the Atomic Language Model Blog

Welcome to the official blog of the Atomic Language Model (ALM) project - a revolutionary approach to AI that proves bigger isn't always better.

## About the Project

The Atomic Language Model is a language model that's **14,000,000x smaller** than GPT-3, weighing in at under 50KB, and formally verified with mathematical precision. Built on Noam Chomsky's Minimalist Grammar with a Rust core and Python layer, it guarantees recursive structures and bounded memory through Coq proofs.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Under 50KB total size
- **Formally Verified**: Mathematical proofs ensure correctness
- **Energy Efficient**: Runs on low-power devices
- **Safety-Critical Ready**: Certified for regulated industries
- **Open Source**: Available for community contributions

## The Team

Led by David Kypuros of Enterprise Neurosystem and a passionate Ugandan team:
- Kato Steven Mubiru
- Bronson Bakunga  
- Sibomana Glorry
- Gimei Alex
