# üéÆ Examples and Tutorials

> **Hands-on examples to master recursive language processing**

Learn by doing! This page provides practical examples, tutorials, and exercises to help you understand and use the Atomic Language Model effectively.

## üöÄ Quick Examples

### Example 1: Mathematical Proof of Recursion
```bash
# Generate the famous a^n b^n pattern
cd atomic-lang-model/atomic-lang-model
cargo run --release

# You'll see mathematical proof of non-regularity:
# n=0: Œµ (empty)
# n=1: a b
# n=2: a a b b
# n=3: a a a b b b
```

**What this proves**: Our grammar generates patterns that finite-state machines cannot recognize, demonstrating true recursion.

### Example 2: Parse Natural Language
```bash
# Test with different sentence structures
cargo run --release -- parse "the student left"
cargo run --release -- parse "the student who arrived left"
cargo run --release -- parse "the student who the teacher praised left"
```

**What this shows**: How recursive rules handle increasingly complex sentence structures.

### Example 3: Run Mathematical Tests
```bash
# Verify core mathematical properties
cargo test test_complete_recursive_proof

# You'll see proof that the implementation:
# ‚úÖ Generates non-regular languages
# ‚úÖ Handles recursive parsing
# ‚úÖ Maintains memory efficiency
# ‚úÖ Demonstrates unbounded capacity
```

## üìö Detailed Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Understanding the Grammar Engine

**Goal**: Learn how Merge and Move operations work

**Step 1**: Examine the core operations
```rust
// Look at src/lib.rs - the Merge operation
fn merge(a: SyntacticObject, b: SyntacticObject) -> Result<SyntacticObject, DerivationError> {
    // This implements: Merge(Œ±:=_X Œ≤, X:Œ≥) = ‚ü®X, [], [Œ±, Œ≥]‚ü©
}
```

**Step 2**: Trace a simple derivation
```bash
# Run with debug output to see derivation steps
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- parse "the student left"
```

**Step 3**: Modify the lexicon
```rust
// Add new words to test_lexicon() in src/lib.rs
LexItem::new("quickly", &[Feature::Cat(Category::V)]),
LexItem::new("book", &[Feature::Cat(Category::N)]),
```

**Step 4**: Test your changes
```bash
cargo run --release -- parse "the student quickly left"
```

### Tutorial 2: Exploring Recursive Patterns

**Goal**: Understand different types of recursion in language

**Step 1**: Center-embedding (the hard case)
```
Level 0: "The student left"
Level 1: "The student [who arrived] left"  
Level 2: "The student [who the teacher [that I know] praised] left"
```

**Step 2**: Right-branching (the easy case)
```
Level 0: "I think Mary left"
Level 1: "I think [that Mary believes [that John left]]"
Level 2: "I think [that Mary believes [that John said [that Sue arrived]]]"
```

**Step 3**: Test both patterns
```bash
# These should work (right-branching is easier)
cargo run --release -- parse "I think that Mary left"
cargo run --release -- parse "I think that Mary said that John left"

# These are harder (center-embedding)
cargo run --release -- parse "the student who left smiled"
cargo run --release -- parse "the student who the teacher praised left"
```

**Why the difference?** Center-embedding requires more working memory than right-branching.

### Tutorial 3: Performance Analysis

**Goal**: Understand computational complexity in practice

**Step 1**: Measure parsing time
```bash
# Run performance tests
cargo test --release test_performance_tests

# Check memory usage
cargo test --release test_recursive_depth_scaling
```

**Step 2**: Binary size optimization
```bash
# Build with different optimization levels
cargo build --release                    # Standard optimization
cargo build --release --profile min-size # Maximum size optimization

# Check the results
ls -lh target/release/atomic-lm
```

**Step 3**: Complexity analysis
```bash
# Test with increasing sentence lengths
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Testing length $i"
  time cargo run --release -- generate an_bn $i
done
```

### Tutorial 4: Formal Verification

**Goal**: Work with mathematical proofs

**Step 1**: Install Coq (optional)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install coq

# macOS
brew install coq
```

**Step 2**: Examine the formal specification
```bash
# Look at the Coq formalization
cat Coq/Minimalist.v

# Key theorems to understand:
# - center_language_not_regular
# - mg_generates_nonregular  
# - discrete_infinity
```

**Step 3**: Verify proofs (advanced)
```bash
cd Coq
coqc Minimalist.v
```

## üß™ Interactive Exercises

### Exercise 1: Extend the Lexicon
**Challenge**: Add 5 new words and test sentences using them.

```rust
// Add to test_lexicon() in src/lib.rs:
LexItem::new("quickly", &[Feature::Cat(Category::V)]),
LexItem::new("silently", &[Feature::Cat(Category::V)]),
LexItem::new("book", &[Feature::Cat(Category::N)]),
LexItem::new("computer", &[Feature::Cat(Category::N)]),
LexItem::new("reads", &[Feature::Cat(Category::V), Feature::Sel(Category::DP)]),
```

**Test sentences**:
- "the student quickly left"
- "the student reads the book"  
- "the student who reads the book quickly left"

### Exercise 2: Generate Longer Patterns
**Challenge**: Generate a¬π‚Å∞b¬π‚Å∞ and verify it's correct.

```bash
# Generate the pattern
cargo run --release -- generate an_bn 10

# Verify it manually - should be:
# "a a a a a a a a a a b b b b b b b b b b"
```

**Questions**:
- How long would a¬≤‚Å∞b¬≤‚Å∞ be?
- What would happen with a¬π‚Å∞‚Å∞b¬π‚Å∞‚Å∞?
- Why can't finite-state machines handle this?

### Exercise 3: Memory Profiling
**Challenge**: Find the memory limit for your system.

```bash
# Test increasing complexity
cargo test test_recursive_depth_scaling

# Try larger workspaces
# Edit the memory_limit in Workspace::new() and recompile
```

### Exercise 4: Create New Test Cases
**Challenge**: Write test cases for new linguistic phenomena.

```rust
// Add to tests/recursion.rs:
#[test]
fn test_my_linguistic_pattern() {
    let lexicon = test_lexicon();
    
    // Test your pattern here
    let result = parse_sentence("your test sentence", &lexicon);
    assert!(result.is_ok(), "Should parse successfully");
}
```

## üî¨ Advanced Examples

### Example: Benchmark Against Other Systems
```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
cargo test --release run_complete_benchmark

# Compare with theoretical predictions
cargo test --release test_complexity_analysis
```

### Example: Cross-Platform Compilation
```bash
# Build for different targets
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl    # Static Linux
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown       # WebAssembly

# Check binary sizes across platforms
ls -lh target/*/release/atomic-lm
```

### Example: Integration with Other Tools
```python
# Example Python wrapper (create this file)
import subprocess
import json

def parse_sentence(sentence):
    result = subprocess.run([
        'cargo', 'run', '--release', '--', 'parse', sentence
    ], capture_output=True, text=True, cwd='atomic-lang-model')
    return result.stdout

# Use it
print(parse_sentence("the student left"))
```
