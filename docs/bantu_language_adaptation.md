# Adapting the Atomic Language Model for Bantu/Ugandan Languages

This document outlines a strategy and ideas for adapting the Atomic Language Model (ALM) to support Bantu and specific Ugandan languages like Luganda, Swahili, and Runyankore. This initiative aims to create Uganda's first indigenous Minimalist Grammar-based language architecture, leveraging the ALM's unique strengths for resource-constrained environments.

## 1. Feasibility and Newsworthiness

Adapting the ALM for Ugandan languages is highly feasible and could be significantly newsworthy due to:

*   **First of its Kind:** Potentially the first formally verified, ultra-lightweight language model architecture specifically for these languages.
*   **Resource-Constrained Environments:** The ALM's minimal size (<50KB binary, zero dependencies) makes it ideal for deployment on basic mobile phones, embedded systems, and for offline use, crucial in many African contexts.
*   **Linguistic Preservation & Digital Inclusion:** Contributes to the digital presence and preservation of under-resourced languages.
*   **Educational & Practical Applications:** Foundation for language learning tools, literacy programs, accessibility features, and research.
*   **Contrast with LLMs:** Demonstrates powerful, formally guaranteed language processing with a tiny footprint, offering an alternative to massive, resource-intensive models.

## 2. Core Adaptation Ideas

### 2.1. Core Architecture

*   **Hybrid Model:**
    *   **Rust Core:** Handles formal syntax with Minimalist Grammar, extended for Bantu-specific features.
    *   **Python Layer:** Manages probabilistic generation and prediction with language-specific rules.
*   **Modularity:**
    *   Separate modules for each language (e.g., `luganda.rs`, `swahili_rules.py`) or configuration files (e.g., JSON) for dynamic rule loading.
    *   CLI flags (`--language luganda`) or API parameters for language selection.
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   Continue using Rust macros to generate `Category` enums and other structures, maintaining the binary size target of <50KB.
    *   Consider implementing an `O(n³)` Earley parser in Python for more robust structural validation during development/testing, while the Rust core remains the primary parser.

### 2.2. Key Features to Implement

*   **Noun Class Agreement:** Enforce noun class agreement in Rust's `merge` operation and Python's rule expansion (e.g., `NP1 → N1`). This is critical for Bantu languages.
    *   **Action:** Extend `Category` enum to include `N1`, `N2`, `N3`, `N4` (and more as needed) for Bantu noun classes. Add `NounClass(u8)` to `Feature` enum to enforce agreement.
    *   **Files:** `atomic-lang-model/src/lib.rs`
*   **Morphological Parsing:** Implement a rule-based morpheme tokenizer.
    *   **Action:** Develop `tokenize_morphemes` function to handle agglutinative morphology (e.g., splitting `a-na-pika` in Swahili).
    *   **Files:** `atomic-lang-model/src/lib.rs` (for Rust-based tokenization) and `atomic-lang-model/python/tiny_lm.py` (for Python-based tokenization).
*   **Multilingual API:** Extend the existing Flask API.
    *   **Action:** Add language-specific endpoints (e.g., `/generate/swahili?count=5`).
    *   **File:** `atomic-lang-model/python/api_server.py`
*   **Lightweight Training:** Adjust rule weights for the probabilistic component.
    *   **Action:** Use small corpora or crowdsourced data to refine probabilities in `PG_RULES` for each language.
    *   **File:** `atomic-lang-model/python/tiny_lm.py`

## 3. Development Roadmap (Phased Approach)

*   **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1–2 Months):**
    *   Address Rust parsing failures by exploring alternative derivation engine approaches (e.g., exhaustive/backtracking) or refining the greedy strategy.
    *   Implement full support for a pilot language (e.g., Swahili: lexicon, rules, basic parsing).
    *   Test simple sentences like "mtu anapika" (Swahili for "person is cooking").
*   **Phase 2: Full Bantu Support (3–4 Months):**
    *   Add support for additional languages like Luganda and Runyankore.
    *   Integrate Rust and Python more tightly (e.g., using `pyo3` for direct calls to Rust's `parse_sentence` from Python).
*   **Phase 3: Deployment & Community (5–6 Months):**
    *   Deploy the REST API with language-specific endpoints.
    *   Test on target IoT devices in Uganda.
    *   Open-source with a comprehensive contribution guide.

## 4. Community Engagement & Data

*   **Linguistic Expertise:** Collaborate with linguists specializing in Swahili, Luganda, Runyankore, etc., to accurately capture their grammatical structures.
*   **Data Collection:** Address data scarcity for less-resourced languages through crowdsourcing initiatives (e.g., via social media, Google Forms).
*   **Workshops & Partnerships:** Host workshops at local universities (e.g., Makerere University) to train developers and linguists, fostering community contributions.

## 5. Applications

*   **Language Learning:** Develop interactive applications for learning Luganda, Swahili, Runyankore.
*   **Translation:** Create English ↔ Bantu translators for offline use.
*   **Voice Assistants:** Deploy on IoT devices for rural communities, enabling local language interaction.

## 6. Research Opportunities

*   **Neural Embeddings:** Explore integrating lightweight neural embeddings (e.g., FastText) for handling out-of-vocabulary words, while preserving the model's zero-dependency core.
*   **Formal Verification Expansion:** Extend Coq proofs to cover Bantu language grammars, ensuring their syntactic correctness.
*   **Cross-Linguistic Patterns:** Research and develop a unified Bantu model that captures commonalities across the language family.

This plan aims to create impactful AI tools for Ugandan languages, demonstrating how theoretical insights and efficient data access can create powerful, culturally relevant language technology.
