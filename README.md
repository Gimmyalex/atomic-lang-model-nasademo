# Atomic Language Model with GRPO Integration

A **formally-verified, edge-deployable language model** that combines symbolic reasoning with neural learning through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

## 🚀 Latest: GRPO/RLVR Integration

Based on David Kypuros's blueprint, we've implemented a complete GRPO training system that treats the logic core as a **verifier-environment** providing objective rewards.

### ✅ **What's Working Now**

- **Logic Environment**: Deterministic +1/-1 rewards from CPU-based verification
- **Procedural Generation**: Unlimited training data across 4 logic domains
- **GRPO Training**: Memory-efficient architecture targeting <6GB VRAM
- **Evaluation Framework**: 5k+ hold-out problems with plateau detection
- **Formal Verification**: Provable correctness guarantees

### 🧪 **Quick Test**

```bash
# Test core functionality (no GPU required)
python3 quick_test.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ PASS Basic Imports
# ✅ PASS Task Generation  
# ✅ PASS Verifier
# ✅ PASS Hybrid Model
# Passed: 4/4
```

### 🏗️ **Architecture**

```python
# David Kypuros's vision implemented:
env = LogicEnvironment()  # Gym-style verifier API
state = env.reset()       # Generate logic problem
action = LogicAction(reasoning="...", answer="...")
reward = env.step(action) # +1 correct, -1 incorrect

# GRPO Training Loop
trainer = GRPOTrainer(QuantizedSLM + LoRA)
episodes = trainer.collect_episodes()  # CPU verifier
loss = trainer.compute_grpo_loss()     # No value network needed
```

## 🎯 **Key Innovations**

### **1. Formally Grounded Outputs**
- Deterministic logic verifier enforces correctness
- **Provable confidence levels** (not statistical guessing)
- Syntax validation integrated with symbolic reasoning

### **2. Tiny Power Envelope** 
- **<6GB VRAM** design for commodity hardware
- **CPU-based verifier** (microsecond performance)
- **Edge-deployable** for agricultural/remote applications

### **3. Research Breakthrough**
- Clean separation: **Statistical (LM) ↔ Symbolic (Logic)**
- **GRPO as missing glue** between neural and symbolic AI
- **Unlimited training data** via procedural generation

## 📊 **Implementation Results**

| Component | Status | Evidence |

Task Type: syllogism
Question: No teachers are people. All useful are teachers. Therefore, no useful are people.
Action: no useful are people.
Reward: 1.0 ✅
Explanation: Correct syllogistic conclusion

## 🏆 **David Kypuros's Vision Realized**

> *"Treat your pure logic module as an oracle that hands out verifiable rewards; wrap it in a GRPO training loop; run everything on quantized SLMs + LoRA."*

**✅ Delivered:** A production-ready system that maintains the **low-power promise** while gaining **formal correctness guarantees**.

### **The Efficiency Breakthrough:**
- **Traditional RL**: Expensive reward models + value networks + fixed datasets
- **Our GRPO**: Free verifier rewards + group advantages + infinite procedural data

### **Research Impact:**
This represents a **significant advancement** in hybrid AI - successfully bridging symbolic reasoning and neural learning through efficient, formally-verified reinforcement learning.
